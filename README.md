# EC2 Cost Governance Dashboard (initial drop)

> Want to make sure that your spend w.r.t EC2 instances does not exceed your expectation? The EC2 Cost Governance Dashboard helps users configure budget limits along with actions. This is meant to be a Proof of Concept (POC) and should not be used in conjunction with production instances. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
